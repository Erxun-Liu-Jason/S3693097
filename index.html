<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>Hi my name is Erxun Liu, And my English name is Jason. I’m from China. This is my first year in RMIT after i finished foundation in La trobe Uni. 

I am currently studying for a three-year Bachelor degree in IT, My hobbies are all about cars, models and video games. Also I love aviation. My knowledge of computer is because of my interest in computer games. I like modding games when i was a kid. An interesting thing about me is I got a 1998 Toyota supra. This one is same as Fast & Furious. I love it so much.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, I’m interest in computer games when i was a kid. Than I’m starting create mod for minecraft. During this time, I have learning something with java. The reason why I choose to come to RMIT because some of my friends are also studying at RMIT. Because of their recommendation and also i want to study something with computer. I hope I can learn the skills I need in the future to become a qualified technician when I get to the work.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>My ideal job is to become a software developer (<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51789261?type=standout#searchRequestToken=73048e73-5390-414a-9e09-65230a5d4978">link text</a>). Software developers are a kind of programmer. There job is generally is analyze users' needs and then design, test, and develop software to meet those needs. Recommend software upgrades for customers' existing programs and systems. This make it has a clear objective. And another reason that appeals to me is because this work often work with a team. I like teamwork when i in the school. But this work need a lot of experience with python, java and API, And I have almost no experience in this area now. This is reason why I need to study hard at RMIT for three years to enrich my knowledge in this area. </p>

<p>From the results of the Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale, My score is 57.</p>
  
<img src="11.PNG">

<p>From those results it can seems like i got quiet or even shy. But I always got vibrant, passionate inner lives. My strengths is Thoughtful, Generous, Open-Minded, Creative, Passionate and Loyal to Their Values. And my weaknesses is Overly Idealistic, Self-Critical, Impractical, Emotionally Driven, Conflict-Averse and Difficult to Get to Know. This personality always care about other people’s feelings in team, And they rarely enjoy succeeding at others’ expense. In general, people with this personality type want to share the good things in their lives. This makes it easy for them to interact with other teammates in the team. Also it can Increases Productivity and have less conflicts. But this personality is sometimes too idealistic. they can take their idealism too far. they expect every aspect of their job to feel meaningful. This can set them up for disappointment when reality falls short of their dreams. This will be a problem that should be solved when I working in a team.</p>
